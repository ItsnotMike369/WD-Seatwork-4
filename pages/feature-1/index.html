      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The 1998 Supra as a base, chucking the original 3.0-litre straight-six 2JZGTE engine and replaced it with a 5.0-litre V12 1GZ-FE that powered the luxurious Toyota Century limousine.</p>
	  <p>Although both engines made similar power, the V12 had the displacement for the abuse Smokey was about to dish out to it. It was mated to a six-speed gearbox which was responsible for transferring all that power to the rear wheels.</p>

      <h2>Smokey Nagata</h2>
	  <h1>Japanese auto mechanic</h1>
	  <p>Kazuhiko “Smokey” Nagata is a living icon in the car tuning scene, popular for building some of the fastest street cars in the world. On top of being a mad scientist who transforms Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) cars into pocket rockets, Smokey Nagata is also the CEO of Top Secret. The Japanese automobile engineer founded Top Secret and established the brand as a leader in tuning and performance parts. It was his high-speed midnight run on the V12 Supra that Smokey Nagata himself built and pushed to 197mph that led to his rise in the tuner community. Today, Top Secret is one of the biggest tuning garages in Japan that works on cars like GT-R, Evo, and S15. </p>

			<h1 class="display-2">Fusion RR Skyline R34</h1>
			<h3>Smokey Nagata is probably one of the very few people who has worked on all generations of Nissan GT-R. His R33 going from 0-186mph in 17 seconds at Yatabe was the trigger that led to his A1(M) run. However, the Fusion RR Skyline R34 is probably an even better build that checks all the boxes. The base car for the Top Secret Fusion RR is a 2001 Nismo N1 Super Taikyu Skyline GT-R R34. The car is powered by an RB26DETT tuned by Top Secret and features a host of upgrades.</h3>

			<h1 class="display-2">Top Secret Silvia S15</h1>
			<h3>The Top Secret Silvia S15 is not a street-legal car, as it was custom-built for the drifting championship (D1GP). However, the build is a perfect demonstration of how Smokey Nagata crafts JDM monsters from scratch. The Top Secret Silvia S15 build for drift champion Ryuji Miki came with the stock SR20DET engine. With Nagata’s craftmanship and expertise, the finished build was able to produce a whopping 534 hp.</h3>

			<h1 class="display-2">Skyline VR 32 GT-R</h1>
			<h3>Top Secret VR 32 GT-R is probably the only Top Secret Smokey Nagata car that’s popular but doesn’t feature the trademark gold paint scheme. On the exterior, it looks more or less like a restored R32, which is one of the oldest generations of Skyline you can get these days. However, underneath the hood and inside the doors, you get an entirely different story! Pop the hood, and you will be shell-shocked to see the engine. Why? Because it is the VR38DETT engine, aka the R35 engine!</h3>
