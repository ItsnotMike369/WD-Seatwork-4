## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
The project demonstrates how to utilize HTML and CSS for coding a features section, encompassing both dynamic and static designs. Its objective is to instruct users in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.








Guiding Question:
- Always prefix the project title with "WD-" followed by your custom naming.
- Do not rename any .html files; always use index.html as the filename.
- Ensure files are placed in their respective folders.
- Use camel case for all file naming.
- Camel case is a naming format where there are no spaces between words; the first word is all lowercase, and the first letter of each subsequent word is uppercase followed by lowercase letters.
Example: style.css
- Use only external CSS.
- Renaming of folders is required and should reflect their purpose or the data they contain.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.
